github repository for the paper: `Enhancing Semantic Segmentation in Chest X-Ray Images through Image Preprocessing: ps-KDE for Pixel-wise Substitution by Kernel Density Estimation`

run `ps_KDE.ipynb` to see a demonstration for the ps-KDE preprocessing

example image used in this repository is a subset of dataset provided by the Japanese Society of Radiological Technology (JSRT) Database (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10628457/). Images are thus all web-sourced and open-access.
